- Use of Flexbox to align elements on the page, both vertically and horizontally
- Use of Grid Layout to divide the page into areas and position elements more precisely
- CSS variables to centralize the definition of colors, fonts and other properties that are repeated in the code
- Advanced selectors like `:nth-child()` to apply specific styles to specific elements
- Animations with `@keyframes` to create transition effects and make the user experience more pleasant.
