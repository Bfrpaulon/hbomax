# HBO Max Page Clone

This is an HBO Max homepage clone project, developed during DIO CSS Developer training. The goal was to practice advanced CSS concepts, such as flexbox, grid layout, CSS variables, advanced selectors and animations.


# Demonstration

- HTML5
- CSS3

## How to use

1. Clone this repository:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/dio-css-hbo-max-clone.git`

2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.

## Concepts Used

- Use of Flexbox to align elements on the page, both vertically and horizontally
- Use of Grid Layout to divide the page into areas and position elements more precisely
- CSS variables to centralize the definition of colors, fonts and other properties that are repeated in the code
- Advanced selectors like `:nth-child()` to apply specific styles to specific elements
- Animations with `@keyframes` to create transition effects and make the user experience more pleasant.
